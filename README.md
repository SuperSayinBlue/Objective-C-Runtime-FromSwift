# Objective-C-Runtime-FromSwift
This project showcases a seamless integration between a client application written in Swift and a dynamic library (dylib) containing Objective-C functions. The goal is to provide developers with a clear example of how to dynamically link and call functions from a dylib at runtime within a Swift application.
